# Building RAG with OpenAI GPT-4o(omni) model Using ObjectBox Vector Database

### What is RAG?
RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is an architectural approach that can improve the efficacy of large language model (LLM) applications by leveraging custom data. This is done by retrieving data/documents relevant to a question or task and providing them as context for the LLM.

RAG is a groundbreaking framework that enhances LLM models by integrating external knowledge sources. RAG overcomes the limitations of LLMs' parametric memory, enabling them to access real-time data, improving contextualization, and providing up-to-date responses.
